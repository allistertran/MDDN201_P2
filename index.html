              <p><b>YEEZY SEASON 4</b> - After holding his fashion show at Madison Square Garden in February and combining it with an album debut the only way Kanye West could have possibly outdone himself this Fashion Week was to essentially rent out an entire island. So he did.The 39-year-old rapper transported New York's fashion elite - along with a host of his A-list friends to Roosevelt Island on Wednesday, forcing major magazine editors, bloggers, and street style stars to board chartered buses in Midtown Manhattan that would take them to the east of the city.There, in Roosevelt Park over an hour and a half past the 3pm scheduled start time, Mr. Kim Kardashian debuted his Season 4 collection in a lengthy catwalk show that saw several models fainting due to the heat, while others actually tripped up on the runway . . . <a href="">VIEW MORE</a></p>

              <p><b>MINIMAL EDIT</b> - Another year, another set of Christmas gift lists to do! Shopping for gifts are fun but take a lot of energy and grief [cause bank account drainage]. Yet I love this time every year and always look forward to getting the right gifts for all of the important people in my life. This is for the minimalists. Now that could mean a range of things but in this list, it's things that adhere too a minimalist's aesthetic bit necessarily something that a minimalist person would enjoy. Things that are sleek and simple with an aesthetically pleasing look. Whether it's nice packaging or just really, really pretty then you're going in the right direction. These are just some of things I've found that would be super cool for a person who is into that minimalist aesthetic . . . <a href="">VIEW MORE</a></p>

              <p><b>TREND REPORT: EMBROIDERED BOMBER JACKETS</b> - What's silky, colourful, and embroidered all over? Embroidered bomber jackets, of course. This style of jacket has been making quite the statement in recent collections and street style imagery alike, and is selling out on retail sites left and right (to no surprise). There is something special about this jacket that we can't quite put our finger on. Is it the contrast of the ornate embroidery on the sporty silhouette? Or is it the statement-making colours and unique detailing? Either way, there is nothing we don't love about them . . . <a href=""><b>VIEW MORE</b></a></p>
